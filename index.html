            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Pedro, I'm an Andalusian web developer who lives in Madrid.</p>
            <p>I've studied psychology in Universidad de Granada and I have a master in psychopharmacology and drugs abuse. Unfortunately I didn't have the chance to work in something related.</p>
            <p>For six years I worked in marketing as a CRM manager in a gaming company.  There was where I started to learn a few programming languages like HTML5 or SQL and discover a new passion: ¡Coding! </p>
            <p>It was time to recycling my career again. So after my last job I started to learn how to be a web developer by myself.</p>
            <p>I haven't finnished my studies yet but I am a very commited person so I work very hard everyday to become a great dev and live happily doing something that I really like.</p>
            <p>I have many hobbies! I practice boxing five days a week. I play bass, make my own craft beer and play indie videogames. Also I love walking with my dogs even if it's raining!</p>
